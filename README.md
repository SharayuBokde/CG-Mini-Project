# CG-Mini-Project
Boat-Racing Game

<p>This Project is an implementation of a racing game which used to be one of our favorites during childhood. This game has been implemented in the language C++ on the complier Turbo C++. The game is made using the inbuilt libraries in C such as dos.h , graphics.h,  etc.</p>

<b>Working:</b>
<p>On pressing Crtl + F9 the code runs and the game begins.
On the right hand side of the screen, we have the distance bar which shows how much distance is left until we reach the destination. We use the mouse to move the boat right and left. The game is over when you reach the destination without clashing with the obstacles. On pressing the key ‘ESC’ you can exit the game. There is a score tab at the right hand top corner of the screen to display the score. </p>

<p>The race starts when you press SPACE or ENTER</p>
